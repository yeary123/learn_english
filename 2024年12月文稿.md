我被裁员了。接下来的路要怎么走下去呢？好几个月以前我就思考这个问题了。
继续找安卓开发的工作是可以的，但是我认为是饮鸩止渴。再过一两年还是会面对当下的困境。
我想要写公众号，但是肚子里墨水空空。
看了李笑来老师发起的1000小时训练。我想要尝试一下。
I was laid off. How should I proceed from here? I've been thinking about this question for several months. Continuing to look for a job as an Android developer is possible, but I think it's like drinking poison to quench thirst. In another year or two, I will still face the current predicament. I want to write a public account, but my mind is empty of knowledge. After seeing the 1000-hour training initiative launched by Teacher Li Xiaolai, I want to give it a try.

1000小时训练是哪里打动了我呢？
首先是关于健脑和健身的部分。随着科技的进步，人确实可以越来越懒，毕竟不动身不动脑也能活下去。但是一想到若不刻意练习自己可能会越来越像个弱智就觉得很可怕。
我愿意健脑，就从现在开始。希望我能坚持下去。
What exactly attracted me about the 1,000-hour training? Firstly, it's the parts about brain training and physical fitness. With the progress of science and technology, people can indeed become lazier and lazier. After all, they can survive without moving their bodies or using their brains. However, it's really terrifying to think that I might become more and more like a person with low intelligence if I don't practice deliberately. I'm willing to train my brain, and I'll start right now. I hope I can persevere.

我选择将作业结果放到公众号上，这样我的公众号就也有内容可以写了。
每天上午九点半或十点开始阅读学习，上午十一点半完成。这样我上午的时间就很充实了。
下午的时间我会安排一些健身。毕竟肌肉很重要，我想延缓它们的流失。
还要将作业内容发表到公众号上，这是一项重复工作。
I've chosen to post the results of my assignments on my WeChat official account, so that there will be something for me to write about on it.  
I start reading and studying at half past nine or ten o'clock every morning and finish it by half past eleven in the morning. In this way, my morning time will be quite fulfilling.  
I will arrange some fitness activities in the afternoon. After all, muscles are very important and I want to slow down their loss.  
I also need to publish the content of my assignments on the WeChat official account, which is a repetitive task.

昨天说我对日常的安排并没有说完。但是字数超过100了，我就停下来了，我想把内容放到下一天来继续。
为什么？
我不想一开始就给自己太大压力。
一开始的压力太大，几乎就等于坚持不了太长时间就放弃。这方面我很有经验。
很遗憾，在我表述原因的时候，100字又到了，我只能明天再继续了。
Yesterday, I said that I hadn't finished talking about my daily arrangements. However, as the number of words exceeded 100, I stopped. I planned to continue the content the next day.  
Why?  
I don't want to put too much pressure on myself at the very beginning.  
Too much pressure at the start almost means giving up without being able to persevere for a long time. I'm quite experienced in this regard.  
Unfortunately, when I was explaining the reasons, the 100 words were reached again, so I could only continue tomorrow.

难以想象我的日常安排竟然说了三天。
上午的固定任务是学英语。
下午的固定任务是发表公众号，这花不了几分钟。
健身需要一周安排几次，我会请私教帮我制定计划。
剩下的时间用来阅读、思考、娱乐。
没有娱乐是不行的，可以看电影、聊天。
晚上的固定任务是带娃。
It's hard to imagine that my daily schedule was said for three days.
The regular task in the morning is to learn English.
The fixed task in the afternoon is to publish a blog on WeChat, which does not take more than a few minutes.
Gyms need to be scheduled several times a week, and I will ask a personal trainer to help me make a plan.
The rest of the time is spent reading, thinking, and entertaining.
Entertainment is essential, and I can watch movies or chat.
The fixed task in the evening is to take care of my baby.

想要坚持下去，最需要克服的难关是什么？
是内心的犹疑。
我做这件事，费这么大力气，到底有没有用？
这个问题必然时时出现在我心里，在我感觉枯燥无聊时，在我感觉毫无进展时，在我看见别人得到成就时。
我现在没办法回答这个问题。但是，未来我会不断回答这个问题。
What is the most difficult obstacle to overcome if you want to persevere?
It's inner hesitation.
I'm putting so much effort into this. Is it really useful after all?
This question will inevitably pop up in my mind from time to time, when I feel bored, when I feel that there's been no progress at all, and when I see others achieving something.
I can't answer this question right now. 
However, I will continue to answer this question in the future.

# 12.23
我想我已经知道如何坚持下去了。
答案是，不用目标来折磨自己，而是珍视当下学到的一个单词一个句子一个发音。
当人专注在目标上时，会给自己带来压力，还会苛责自己，觉得自己做得不够好。
不去关注目标，你才会为学到的一个很小的知识点而雀跃。
我想要一直雀跃下去。
I think I already know how to keep going.  
The answer is not to torture myself with goals, but to cherish every word, sentence and pronunciation that I've learned at present.  
When people focus on goals, they will put pressure on themselves and be overly critical of themselves, feeling that they haven't done well enough.  
Only when you don't focus on goals will you be excited about a tiny bit of knowledge you've learned.  
I will stay excited all the time.

第一天学英语，公众号就吸引来了一些粉丝。
这让我很开心。看来即使有AI的打击，学英语依旧是很多人向往的事。
如果我做的这件事能影响一些人，让他们也走上开始学习的道路，那我可太骄傲了。
如果我能坚持到最后，让大家看到一开始的蹩脚发音和最后的流利英语之间的区别，我觉得我能配上的一首振奋人心的bgm。
On the first day of learning English, the WeChat official account attracted some followers.  
It makes me really happy.
It seems that even with the impact of AI, learning English is still something that many people aspire to do.  
If what I'm doing can influence some people and get them started on the path of learning as well, then I'll be so proud.  
If I can persevere until the end and let everyone see the difference between my clumsy pronunciation at the beginning and my fluent English in the end, I think I'll deserve an inspiring background music.

只有一种读书方式可以越读越快，那就是专题阅读。
找来10本同一专题的书，读第一本需要一个月，因为里面的概念你几乎完全不懂，你需要一页一页的认真阅读。
读第二本的时候就只需要认真阅读百分之八十的内容，因为那百分之二十已经在第一本书中读过了。
以此类推，等读到第十本书，可能你只是翻翻目录，找出一两个小节来读，这本书你就完全明白讲的是什么了。
There is only one way of reading that enables you to read faster and faster, and that is reading by topic.
Get ten books on the same topic. It may take you a month to read the first book because you hardly understand any of the concepts in it and you need to read it carefully page by page.
When you read the second book, you only need to read 80 percent of the content carefully, as the other 20 percent has already been covered in the first book.
By the same token, when you come to the tenth book, perhaps you just need to flip through the table of contents and pick out one or two sections to read, and then you will fully understand what this book is about.

怎样才能从输赢思维中拔出来？
我觉得答案是，升维。
当你处于争输赢状态时，你只有两个选项，战或者逃。你的全部心智都被填满了。
升维就是你看到更广阔的情景，你不再只有战或逃两个选项。
你还可以选择照顾好自己，你可以看到双赢的可能，或者其他可行的方案。
How can one break free from the win-lose mindset?  
I think the answer lies in ascending to a higher dimension.  
When you are in a state of competing for a win or a loss, you only have two options: fight or flight. Your entire mind is occupied.  
Ascending to a higher dimension means that you can perceive a broader scenario and no longer have just the two options of fight or flight.  
You can also choose to take good care of yourself. You can see the possibility of a win-win situation or other viable solutions.

到底什么是爱自己？如何爱自己？
首先是身体的照料，是否饿了渴了？是否困了累了？肠胃是否舒服？身体冷还是热？
如果身体层面没有一点点的不舒服，恭喜你，你完成了第一个层次的爱自己。
然后是心理的照料，我是否因为某些事情心情郁闷？我是不是可以做些什么让心情好一些？
当你有能力让自己情绪好起来，恭喜你，你完成了第二个层面的爱自己。
What exactly is loving yourself? And how to love yourself?  
Firstly, it's about taking care of the body. Are you hungry or thirsty? Are you sleepy or tired? Is your stomach comfortable? Do you feel cold or hot?  
If there isn't the slightest discomfort on the physical level, congratulations! You've accomplished the first level of loving yourself.  
Then, there's the psychological care. Am I feeling depressed because of certain things? Can I do something to make myself feel better?  
When you are capable of cheering yourself up, congratulations! You've accomplished the second level of loving yourself.

刚刚看了一场直播。
一个女孩在用英语直播，她口语很流利，鼓励大家连麦和她对话。
她曾做过英语老师，但是不适应职场氛围，于是出来做自媒体。
她没有出国留学过，只是在国内上了大学。但是她的口语到达了这种水平，让我很震惊也很佩服。
我有被鼓励到，只要认真学，我也可以有流利的英语口语。
I just watched a live stream. 
A girl was live streaming in English. Her spoken English was very fluent and she encouraged everyone to go on live connection with her to have a conversation. 
She used to be an English teacher, but she couldn't adapt to the working atmosphere, so she turned to work in the field of self-media. 
She had never studied abroad and just went to college within the country.
However, the fact that her spoken English has reached such a high level really shocked and impressed me. 
I was inspired.
As long as I study hard, I can also have fluent spoken English.

我的信用卡被扣了300多美元，但是我没有用啊。
紧急联系银行挂失了，银行又帮我查询这张信用卡的交易记录，发现这次扣费和一年前的一次扣费，交易方是同一家公司。
我于是想起来，去年一时兴起买了海外服务器，这是快到期了，就给我自动扣费了。
赶忙登上那个网站，申请退款一气呵成。
又等了一天，退款到账了，还好还好，有惊无险。
More than 300 dollars were deducted from my credit card, but I didn't use it at all.  
I urgently contacted the bank to report the loss. 
Then the bank helped me check the transaction records of this credit card and found that this deduction was made by the same company as the one a year ago.
Then I remembered that on a whim last year, I bought an overseas server. 
It was about to expire, so it automatically deducted the fee from my card.  
I quickly logged onto that website and applied for a refund in one go.  
After waiting for another day, the refund was credited to my account. 
Fortunately, it was a close call but everything turned out okay.

吵架的时候，有时候我会据理力争，有时候我一句话也说不出来。
据理力争的时候，我觉得自己是有分量的，说出来的话是会被听到的。
一句话也说不出来的时候，我心里想的是，算了，说了也没用，还是不说了吧。
这两种表现的心态都是以外界评价为中心，外界是安全的，我说，外界是不安全的，我不说。
这种心态是错的。
无论如何都要说出自己的道理，不管对方对我的态度如何。
这是一种传达和宣誓，我将保卫我自己，与任何人都无关。
When arguing, sometimes I will argue strongly on just grounds, while sometimes I can't say a word.  
When arguing strongly on just grounds, I feel that I matter and that what I say will be heard.  
When I can't say a word, what I think in my heart is, "Forget it. It's useless to say it, so I'd better keep silent."  
The mentalities behind these two manifestations are both centered around external evaluations. 
If the outside world is safe, I will speak; if it's not safe, I won't.  
This kind of mentality is wrong.  
No matter what, I should state my reasons, regardless of the other person's attitude towards me.  
This is a kind of communication and declaration that I will defend myself and it has nothing to do with anyone else.
